# Homework10
Run leapfrog.py will perform calculations and show a plot of x over time.. I realize this code is not well
commented or finished, and I think the plot is wrong. I felt like I was close to finishing it, but could not 
figure out where I went wrong exactly, and I ran out of time.

Run Homework10.py will perform all calculations, and show the plot of the fixed rk4 first, then the plot
of the adaptive rk4 second. Print statements will print out the answers to the sections that you had asked for.
